## The Problem

Flat vector memory fails autonomous coding agents. Without the ability to trace provenance, relate concepts across a codebase, or understand temporal validity, agents cannot distinguish between deeply vetted architectural rules and outdated drafts. Session recall isn't enough—agents need memory they can govern, trust, and safely update over time.

## What context-fabrica Does

`context-fabrica` is a composable library that combines semantic retrieval, graph traversal, and temporal recall so agents can genuinely reason about their memory. By treating provenance, validity, curation stage, and supersession as first-class data rather than afterthought metadata, it enables agents to justify their answers rather than just retrieving vaguely similar text.

```
Query: "How does PaymentsService interact with LedgerAdapter?"

  Semantic score ──── 0.72  (embedding similarity + BM25 lexical boost)
  Graph score ─────── 0.85  (2-hop traversal: PaymentsService → depends_on → LedgerAdapter)
  Temporal score ──── 0.00  (not a time-scoped query)
  Recency score ───── 0.91  (ingested 3 hours ago)
  Confidence score ── 0.80  (from design-doc source)
                      ────
  Final score ─────── 0.66  (hybrid weighted fusion)
  Rationale: [semantic_match, graph_relation, recent, high_confidence]
```

Every query returns **scored results with full breakdowns** — your agents can reason about *why* a memory was relevant, not just *that* it was.

---

## Perfect for Self-Learning & Self-Improving Agents

`context-fabrica` was designed to give coding agents the scaffolding they need to reason about their own growth and incrementally improve over time:

- **Observation Synthesis:** Agents can piece together raw, disparate facts over time and explicitly *synthesize* them into foundational insights (e.g., "The auth framework in this repo is unstable around token refresh").
- **Memory Tiers & Promotion:** "I saw something once" is not "This is a factual rule." Agents can log low-confidence observations in a `staged` tier. If the observation proves true repeatedly, it gets promoted to `canonical` or extracted as a reusable `pattern` applied to future tasks.
- **Supersession & Error Correction:** When an agent realizes a past assumption was incorrect, it uses supersession chains (soft invalidation). This means it remembers both what it *previously* thought and *why* it updated its understanding, rather than destructively overwriting past knowledge.
- **Temporal Recall:** Agents can explicitly time-scope memories to avoid confusing legacy system knowledge with the current state of a codebase.

---

## Core vs Extensible

context-fabrica separates **what is core** (the retrieval model, memory semantics, and governance) from **what is pluggable** (storage backends, embedders, and entity extraction).

```

**Core** — the retrieval model, ranking formula, memory lifecycle, and governance primitives. These define what context-fabrica *is* and are not meant to be swapped out.

**Extensible** — storage backends, embedding providers, and graph stores are pluggable via Python protocols. Implement the interface, pass it in.

---

## Storage Options

Pick the backend that matches your scale. No code changes needed — the `HybridMemoryStore` API is the same regardless of backend.

| Backend | Dependencies | Server required? | Best for |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **SQLite** (built-in) | None (stdlib) | No | Local dev, single-agent, getting started |
| **Postgres + pgvector** | `psycopg`, `pgvector` | Yes | Production, multi-agent, teams |
| **Kuzu** (optional add-on) | `kuzu` | No | Graph-heavy traversal at scale |
| **Custom** | You decide | You decide | Bring your own (LanceDB, DuckDB, etc.) |

### SQLite — zero setup, no server

```bash
pip install context-fabrica
```

```python
from context_fabrica import HybridMemoryStore, SQLiteRecordStore

store = HybridMemoryStore(store=SQLiteRecordStore("./memory.db"))
store.bootstrap()

# Same API as Postgres — write, query, promote, search
store.write_text(record)
results = store.semantic_search(query_embedding, top_k=5)
```

SQLite stores records, chunks, embeddings, relations, and promotions in a single file. Semantic search uses brute-force cosine similarity — fast enough for local dev and single-agent workloads up to ~50k records.

### Postgres + pgvector — production scale

```bash
pip install "context-fabrica[postgres,kuzu,fastembed]"
```

If you are working from a local clone instead of PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install .
python -m pip install -r requirements-v2.txt
```

```python
from context_fabrica import HybridMemoryStore, HybridStoreSettings, PostgresSettings, KuzuSettings

store = HybridMemoryStore(
    HybridStoreSettings(
        postgres=PostgresSettings(dsn="postgresql:///context_fabrica"),
        kuzu=KuzuSettings(path="./var/graph"),
    )
)
store.bootstrap()
```

Postgres handles records, chunks, HNSW-indexed vector search, validity windows, and provenance. Kuzu is optional — if you don't need multi-hop graph traversal at scale, skip it.

### Postgres without Kuzu

```python
from context_fabrica import HybridMemoryStore
from context_fabrica.storage.postgres import PostgresPgvectorAdapter

store = HybridMemoryStore(
    store=PostgresPgvectorAdapter(PostgresSettings(dsn="postgresql:///context_fabrica"))
)
store.bootstrap()
# No graph projection — relations still stored in Postgres, just no Kuzu traversal
```

### Bring your own backend

Implement the `RecordStore` protocol and pass it in:

```python
from context_fabrica.adapters import RecordStore

class MyLanceDBStore:
    """Implements RecordStore protocol."""
    def bootstrap(self) -> None: ...
    def upsert_record(self, record: KnowledgeRecord) -> None: ...
    def fetch_record(self, record_id: str) -> KnowledgeRecord | None: ...
    def replace_chunks(self, record_id: str, chunks: list) -> None: ...
    def replace_relations(self, record_id: str, relations: list) -> None: ...
    def record_promotion(self, source_id: str, target_id: str, reason: str, promoted_at: datetime) -> None: ...
    def semantic_search(self, query_embedding: list[float], *, domain: str | None, top_k: int) -> list[QueryResult]: ...
    def enqueue_projection(self, record_id: str) -> None: ...

store = HybridMemoryStore(store=MyLanceDBStore(), graph=MyGraphStore())  # graph is optional
```

## Quick Start

Install from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install "context-fabrica[postgres,kuzu,fastembed]"
```

Then bootstrap and verify:

```bash
context-fabrica-bootstrap --dsn "postgresql:///context_fabrica"
context-fabrica-doctor --dsn "postgresql:///context_fabrica"
context-fabrica-demo --dsn "postgresql:///context_fabrica" --project
```

```python
from context_fabrica import DomainMemoryEngine, NamespacePolicy, ScoringWeights, TokenOverlapReranker
from context_fabrica.models import Relation

engine = DomainMemoryEngine(
    reranker=TokenOverlapReranker(),
    namespace_policies={
        "payments": NamespacePolicy(
            min_confidence=0.75,
            source_allowlist=("design-doc", "runbook"),
            rerank_top_n=5,
        )
    },
)  # or DomainMemoryEngine(scoring="embedding")

# Ingest with automatic entity/relation extraction
engine.ingest(
    "PaymentsService depends on LedgerAdapter and calls RiskGateway.",
    source="design-doc",
    domain="fintech",
    confidence=0.8,
)

# Or provide your own entities/relations (e.g. from an upstream LLM)
engine.ingest(
    "The auth service validates tokens before routing to the API gateway.",
    source="architecture-review",
    domain="platform",
    confidence=0.9,
    entities=["auth_service", "api_gateway", "token_validator"],
    relations=[
        Relation("auth_service", "calls", "api_gateway"),
        Relation("auth_service", "uses", "token_validator"),
    ],
)

# Query with full score breakdown
results = engine.query("How does PaymentsService interact with LedgerAdapter?", top_k=3)
for hit in results:
    print(f"{hit.record.record_id}  score={hit.score:.2f}  {hit.rationale}")

# Temporal recall
incident = engine.ingest(
    "Quarterly incident review happened in June 2025.",
    source="incident",
    domain="platform",
    confidence=0.9,
    record_id="incident-june",
)
time_scoped = engine.query("What happened in June 2025?", top_k=3)

# Observation synthesis — combine multiple facts into one provenance-backed record
engine.ingest("AuthService depends on TokenSigner.", record_id="f1", confidence=0.8)
engine.ingest("TokenSigner rotates keys daily.", record_id="f2", confidence=0.9)
observation = engine.synthesize_observation(["f1", "f2"], record_id="obs-1")
assert observation.metadata["derived_from"] == ["f1", "f2"]
```

## Architecture

```
                    +------------------+
                    |   Agent / CLI    |
                    +--------+---------+
                             |
                    +--------v---------+

                             |

  +------v---+ +---v--------+ +-----v------+ +--v--------+
  | Embedding| | BM25       | | Knowledge  | | Temporal  |
  | Similarity | Lexical    | | Graph      | | Overlap   |

                              with decay    windows
```

**Scoring formula (default weights, normalized to sum to 1.0):**
`0.42 * semantic + 0.25 * graph + 0.15 * temporal + 0.10 * recency + 0.07 * confidence`

Where semantic = `0.70 * embedding + 0.30 * BM25` in hybrid mode.
Weights are always normalized at query time, so custom values don't need to sum to 1.0.

Temporal scoring is neutral unless the query or record carries time information.

### Namespace Policies

Use namespace policies when one team or agent needs stricter retrieval than another without forking the engine:

```python
from context_fabrica import DomainMemoryEngine, NamespacePolicy, ScoringWeights

engine = DomainMemoryEngine(
    namespace_policies={
        "production-ops": NamespacePolicy(
            weights=ScoringWeights(semantic=0.45, graph=0.25, temporal=0.25, recency=0.10, confidence=0.10),
            min_confidence=0.8,
            source_allowlist=("runbook", "incident", "design-doc"),
            default_hops=1,
            rerank_top_n=8,
        )
    }
)
```

### Persistent Storage

```
  Agent
    |
    v
  HybridMemoryStore ─────── same API regardless of backend
    |
    ├── RecordStore (protocol)
    │     ├── SQLiteRecordStore     ← zero setup, single file
    │     ├── PostgresPgvectorAdapter ← production, HNSW indexing
    │     └── YourCustomAdapter     ← implement the protocol
    │
    └── GraphStore (protocol, optional)
          ├── KuzuGraphProjectionAdapter ← embedded graph
          └── YourCustomGraph            ← implement the protocol
```

When using Postgres, the projection worker uses **LISTEN/NOTIFY** for low-latency graph projection job pickup with polling fallback.

## Memory Tiers

Not every agent output deserves canonical memory. context-fabrica models three tiers:

```
raw observation ──> staged ──> reviewed ──> canonical
repeated pattern ──> mined ──> pattern
```

| Tier | Purpose | In default retrieval? |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| `staged` | Draft notes, low-confidence observations | No |
| `canonical` | Reviewed facts, trusted knowledge | Yes |
| `pattern` | Reusable templates and extracted patterns | Yes |

```python
# Low-confidence notes are auto-staged
draft = engine.ingest("TODO: investigate flaky auth refresh", confidence=0.4)
assert draft.stage == "staged"  # excluded from queries

# Promote after review
engine.promote_record(draft.record_id)  # now canonical, queryable
```

## Embedder Options

| Embedder | Dimensions | Dependencies | Quality |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `HashEmbedder` (default) | 1536 | None | Deterministic hashing, good for dev/testing |
| `FastEmbedEmbedder` | 384 | `fastembed` | Lightweight ML, good balance |
| `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` | 384+ | `sentence-transformers` | Production-quality semantic similarity |

```python
from context_fabrica import DomainMemoryEngine, SentenceTransformerEmbedder

# Production setup with real embeddings
engine = DomainMemoryEngine(
    embedder=SentenceTransformerEmbedder(),
    scoring="hybrid",
)
```

## MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)

context-fabrica ships a zero-dependency MCP server that any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) can discover and use. The server runs locally as a subprocess — no hosting required.

**Install and configure:**

```bash
pip install context-fabrica
```

Add to your project's `.mcp.json` (or `~/.claude/settings.json` for global use):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-fabrica": {
      "command": "context-fabrica-mcp",
      "args": ["--db", "./memory.db", "--namespace", "myproject"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Available tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `remember` | Store a fact, observation, or insight in long-term memory |
| `recall` | Search memory for relevant knowledge with scored results |
| `synthesize` | Combine multiple facts into a provenance-backed observation |
| `promote` | Promote a staged draft memory to canonical status |
| `invalidate` | Soft-delete a memory that is no longer valid |
| `supersede` | Replace an existing memory with an updated version |

Once configured, your agent can use these tools directly:

```
Agent: "Let me check if I already know about the auth service architecture."
→ calls recall("auth service architecture")

Agent: "I learned that TokenSigner rotates keys daily. Let me remember that."
→ calls remember("TokenSigner rotates keys daily", source="code-review", confidence=0.9)
```

## Claude Code Skills

If you're using Claude Code, context-fabrica includes slash commands that wrap the MCP tools:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/remember <text>` | Store knowledge in memory |
| `/recall <query>` | Search memory for relevant facts |
| `/synthesize <ids or topic>` | Synthesize an observation from multiple facts |
| `/memory-status` | Overview of what's stored in memory |

These commands are defined in `.claude/commands/` and work automatically when the MCP server is configured.

## CLI

```bash
# Query from JSONL dataset
context-fabrica --dataset records.jsonl --query "How is TokenSigner connected?" --top-k 5

# MCP server (usually started by the client, but can run manually)
context-fabrica-mcp --db ./memory.db --namespace myproject

# Postgres operations
context-fabrica-bootstrap --dsn "postgresql:///context_fabrica"
context-fabrica-doctor --dsn "postgresql:///context_fabrica"
context-fabrica-demo --dsn "postgresql:///context_fabrica" --project

# Projection worker
context-fabrica-projector --once            # process pending jobs
context-fabrica-projector --status          # queue summary
context-fabrica-projector --retry-failed    # requeue failed jobs

# Project memory bootstrap
context-fabrica-project-memory bootstrap --root .
```

## Where It Fits

**Good fit:**
- Coding agents that need durable codebase/domain memory
- Multi-agent systems that share a canonical knowledge layer
- Orchestration systems wanting inspectable, auditable memory
- Control-plane UIs that need evidence, freshness, and relation visibility

**Not a fit:**
- Pure chatbot session memory
- Replacement for your agent runtime/orchestrator
- Generic BI or human-only knowledge portal

## Governance Primitives

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `valid_from` / `valid_to` | Temporal validity windows, enables as-of queries |
| `occurred_from` / `occurred_to` | Event-time windows for time-scoped recall |
| `invalidate_record()` | Soft deletion with reason tracking |
| `stage` / `kind` | Promotion routing and curated retrieval |
| `reviewed_at` | Promotion auditability |
| `confidence` | Trust prior in ranking |
| `source` / `metadata` | Provenance for policy gates |
| `namespace` / `NamespacePolicy` | Tenant isolation plus namespace-specific retrieval controls |
| `supersedes` | Record replacement chains |
