# context-fabrica v2 Architecture

## Decision

`context-fabrica` v2 uses:
- `Postgres + pgvector` as the only write authority
- `Kuzu` as a graph projection for traversal-heavy reads

This keeps ingestion, provenance, freshness, invalidation, and embeddings in one system while letting graph reasoning specialize where it helps.

## Why This Split

### Postgres owns

- durable memory records
- semantic chunks + embeddings
- validity windows
- curation stage (`staged` / `canonical` / `pattern`)
- provenance and metadata
- typed relation rows
- promotion/invalidation history
- projection job queue

### Kuzu owns

- projected entity graph
- relation traversal
- neighborhood expansion
- impact and dependency path queries

## Write Flow

1. Agent writes or updates a `KnowledgeRecord`.
2. A promotion policy classifies it into `staged`, `canonical`, or `pattern`.
3. Postgres stores the canonical record state, chunk embeddings, and typed relation rows.
4. Canonical/pattern writes enqueue a projection job in Postgres.
5. Projection extracts entities and typed relations.
6. Kuzu receives projected `MemoryRecord`, `Entity`, `HAS_ENTITY`, and `RELATED` edges.

## Read Flow

1. Semantic retrieval starts in Postgres via `pgvector`.
2. `staged` records are filtered out unless explicitly requested.
3. Matching records expose entities/relations.
4. Kuzu expands nearby entities or paths when relation reasoning matters.
5. `context-fabrica` fuses semantic, graph, recency, and confidence signals.

## Why Postgres Remains Canonical

- one authoritative write path
- easier invalidation and replay
- easier backups and migrations
- avoids dual-write drift between vector and graph stores
- executable live repository API now exists for bootstrap, record write, chunk write, relation write, fetch, and semantic search
- package install for the base command surface now works, while the full v2 runtime remains a separately verifiable dependency layer

## Kuzu Deferred Responsibilities

Kuzu is not the source of truth for raw text, provenance, or lifecycle policy. It is a projection optimized for graph reads.

## Initial Schema Contract

### Postgres tables

- `memory_records`
- `memory_chunks`
- `memory_relations`
- `memory_promotions`
- `projection_jobs`

Important fields added for curation:

- `memory_stage`
- `memory_kind`
- `reviewed_at`

Operational controls now include:

- projection queue status listing
- retrying failed jobs
- requeueing projection for a specific record

## Embedding Strategy

- default: dimension-safe `HashEmbedder` for zero-friction local installs
- optional: `FastEmbed` when using 384-d schemas for stronger local embeddings
- advanced: custom embedder injection for sentence-transformers or hosted providers

### Kuzu tables

- `MemoryRecord`
- `Entity`
- `HAS_ENTITY`
- `RELATED`

## When This Architecture Is Worth It

- agents must retrieve relevant codebase knowledge and also explain impact chains
- multiple sessions need durable memory with governance
- relation-heavy questions are important enough to justify projection

## When To Avoid It

- semantic retrieval alone solves most of the problem
- you do not yet have stable entity or relation extraction
- you are still validating whether graph traversal matters in the product
